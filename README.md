This Streamlit application provides an interactive chatbot that uses the Feynman Technique to help users learn new concepts. The chatbot uses the **LLaMA 405b model** for generating responses. It can provide feedback on user explanations or offer detailed explanations of various topics. Additionally, users can save conversations and responses to categorized folders for future reference.

The repo for the code is private and only for personal use

## Important Notes

This is a personal project, so there is no dedicated database to store the chat history, therefore we are using localStorage to store the messages and folders. Make sure to clear history as needed as to not exceed the localStorage storage space.
